Lets practice Git Work Flow
1. Go to GIT HUB and create a directory.
2. Do git clone and add the URL of the repository you just created.
3. CD into that directory
4. Touch a README.md and your main file
5. Do a git remote -v to see your directory
6. Do a git add to add to the staging area
7. DO a git commit -m to commit the changes. Remember to add your notes within " ... "
8. Always do a git status in between
9. After you make any changes the files should be in red
10. Keep doing git add, git commit and git status until you are done. 
11. To be lazy, you can add all with git add .
12. This should make all go from red to green. Let's test.
